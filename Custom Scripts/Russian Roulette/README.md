# Windows Russian Roulette

## DISCLAIMER: Be advised, this code may cause several damage to your computer as it deletes important files from  it. I take no responsability for damage caused, as this was only made as a joke.

This code generates a random number between 0 and 6 to represent a bullet being put inside one of the gun chambers. If the next random number is equal that first value, the System32 folder is completly destroyed. Again, it's just a joke, this isn't made to be used anywhere.
